/** A Scene is used to display a view on the screen.
 If a view can be contained in another view, a scene is needed to display the root view. A Scene takes care of dispatching user events to the currently selected PBControl.

 You should subclass Scene and use its four events methods: `sceneWillAppear()`, `sceneWillRender()`, `sceneDidRender()`, `sceneWillUnload()` to execute your own code.

 A scene has no render-loop, it is left to the user to implement it. This is made to ensure maximum flexibility fo the user. The `render()` method ttriggers the render of all its view and its subviews in cascade.

 A scene is responsible for the view it is holding, and will free its contained views when being free-ed.

 Interaction between elements of different scenes, and between scenes themselves is undefined behaviour.

 To remove a view, call `dismiss()`, this will remove the view from the render
 loop and free its content.
